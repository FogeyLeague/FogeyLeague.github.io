Welcome to the Fogey League homepage!

Fogey League is a community of players for [Heroes of the Storm](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/).  It was created for players who want to have fun, group-oriented games in a healthy environment that accommodates people with potentially busy lives.

We feature four teams on [Chair League](https://www.chairleague.com/), a recreational league for players to create teams and compete together.

We are a quasi open community.  If you are interested in joining up or learning more what we are about, please reach out to us or one of our members!
