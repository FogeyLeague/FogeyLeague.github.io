Welcome to the Fogey League homepage!

Fogey League is a community of players for [Heroes of the Storm](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/).  It was created for players who want to have fun, group-oriented games in a healthy environment that accommodates people with potentially busy lives.

We feature four teams on [Chair League](https://www.chairleague.com/), a recreational league for players to create teams and compete together.
